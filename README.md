## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

I was tasked with building a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically,  plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them using learned HTML and CSS skills, specifically utilizing Bootstrap components. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is a main landing page, a page to view the comparison of all of the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them.
